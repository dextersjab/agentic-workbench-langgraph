# Prompt Designs for IT Service Desk

## Overview

This document provides detailed designs for the prompts used in each node of the IT Service Desk workflow. These prompts are crucial for the educational focus of the system, as they demonstrate effective prompt engineering techniques for different business tasks.

## 1. Clarify Issue Prompts

### Analysis Prompt

This prompt is used to determine if the user's input needs clarification:

```
You are an IT support analyst reviewing a user's request for clarity and completeness.

User Request: {user_input}
Conversation History: {conversation_history}

Analyze the request and determine if you have enough information to:
1. Categorize the issue (hardware, software, access, other)
2. Assess the priority level
3. Begin resolution steps

Required information includes:
- What specific problem the user is experiencing
- When the problem started
- What systems or devices are affected
- What the user has already tried
- How the issue is impacting their work

Respond with:
- "CLEAR" if you have sufficient information
- "NEEDS_CLARIFICATION" if more details are required

If clarification is needed, explain what specific information is missing.
```

### Clarification Prompt

This prompt is used to generate specific questions when clarification is needed:

```
You are a helpful IT support agent. The user has submitted a request that needs clarification.

User Request: {user_input}
Conversation History: {conversation_history}
Clarification Attempt: {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}

Generate a friendly, specific clarifying question that will help you better understand:
- The exact problem or request
- Steps the user has already tried
- Impact and urgency
- Relevant system/software details

Guidelines:
- Ask for one specific piece of information at a time
- Use simple, non-technical language
- Be empathetic and professional
- Provide examples if helpful

Generate your clarifying question:
```

## 2. Classify Issue Prompt

This prompt is used to categorize the IT issue:

```
You are an IT support specialist categorizing a user's issue.

Conversation History: {conversation_history}

Categorize this issue into one of the following categories:
1. Hardware: Physical device issues (laptop, printer, phone, etc.)
2. Software: Application problems, installation issues, crashes
3. Access: Login problems, permissions, account issues
4. Other: Issues that don't fit the above categories

For each category, provide a confidence score (0-100%).

Also determine the priority level:
- High: Critical business impact, multiple users affected
- Medium: Significant impact to individual productivity
- Low: Minor inconvenience, workarounds available

Respond with:
1. The primary category (most confident)
2. The confidence score for that category
3. The priority level
4. A brief explanation of your categorization

Format your response as:
"I've analyzed your issue and categorized it as [CATEGORY] with [CONFIDENCE]% confidence. This appears to be a [PRIORITY] priority issue because [REASON]."
```

## 3. Triage Issue Prompt

This prompt is used to route the issue to the appropriate support team:

```
You are an IT support triage specialist routing a user's issue to the appropriate team.

Category: {category}
Conversation History: {conversation_history}

Based on the issue category and details, determine:
1. The most appropriate support team
2. The priority level
3. Expected response time

Support Teams:
- L1-Hardware: For basic hardware issues
- L2-Software: For software application issues
- Security-Team: For access and security issues
- General-Support: For miscellaneous issues
- Escalated-*: Prefix for high-priority issues requiring senior attention

Priority Levels:
- High: 1-2 hour response time
- Medium: 4-8 hour response time
- Low: 24-48 hour response time

Respond with:
1. The selected support team
2. The priority level
3. Expected response time
4. A brief explanation of your routing decision

Format your response as:
"I'm routing your issue to our [TEAM] with [PRIORITY] priority. You can expect a response within [TIME]. This routing is based on [REASON]."
```

## 4. Information Gathering Prompt

This prompt is used to collect additional information for the support ticket:

```
You are an IT support agent gathering information for a support ticket.

Category: {category}
Priority: {priority}
Support Team: {support_team}
Conversation History: {conversation_history}

Gather comprehensive information for the support ticket by:
1. Summarizing the issue clearly
2. Extracting relevant technical details
3. Noting any troubleshooting already attempted
4. Identifying business impact
5. Determining user availability for follow-up

For {category} issues, be sure to include:
[CATEGORY-SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS]

Format your response as a professional ticket summary that:
- Starts with a clear issue title
- Includes all relevant details organized in sections
- Ends with next steps and user availability

Your response will be used directly in the support ticket, so ensure it is complete, professional, and actionable for the {support_team}.
```

## 5. Final Response Prompt

This prompt is used to format the final response with ticket information:

```
You are an IT support agent providing a final response to a user after creating a support ticket.

Ticket ID: {ticket_id}
Category: {category}
Priority: {priority}
Support Team: {support_team}
Ticket Information: {ticket_info}

Create a professional, helpful final response that:
1. Confirms the ticket has been created
2. Provides the ticket ID for reference
3. Explains which team will handle the issue
4. Sets expectations for response time based on priority
5. Offers any immediate self-help suggestions if applicable
6. Thanks the user for their patience

Format your response as:
1. Confirmation and ticket ID
2. Support team and expected response time
3. Any immediate suggestions or workarounds
4. Next steps and closing

Your response should be professional, empathetic, and instill confidence that the issue will be resolved.
```

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

Each prompt incorporates several key prompt engineering techniques:

### Role Definition

All prompts begin with a clear role definition:
```
You are an IT support analyst reviewing a user's request...
```

This establishes the context and perspective for the LLM, guiding its response style and focus.

### Context Provision

Relevant context is provided through variables:
```
User Request: {user_input}
Conversation History: {conversation_history}
```

This ensures the LLM has access to all necessary information for generating an appropriate response.

### Task Specification

Each prompt clearly specifies the task:
```
Analyze the request and determine if you have enough information to...
```

This focuses the LLM on the specific objective of the prompt.

### Response Format

The expected response format is explicitly defined:
```
Respond with:
- "CLEAR" if you have sufficient information
- "NEEDS_CLARIFICATION" if more details are required
```

This ensures consistent, parseable outputs that can be used programmatically.

### Guidelines and Constraints

Behavioral guidelines constrain the LLM's responses:
```
Guidelines:
- Ask for one specific piece of information at a time
- Use simple, non-technical language
```

These shape the tone, style, and content of the response.

## Educational Value

These prompts demonstrate several important prompt engineering concepts:

1. **Task-Specific Prompting**: Each prompt is tailored to a specific business task
2. **Structured Output**: Formats are specified for consistent, parseable responses
3. **Role-Based Prompting**: Each prompt establishes a clear role for the LLM
4. **Context Management**: Relevant context is provided through variables
5. **Constraint Application**: Guidelines shape the response characteristics

Students can learn how to:
- Design prompts for specific business workflows
- Create prompts that generate consistent, structured outputs
- Use role definitions to guide LLM behavior
- Manage context effectively in multi-turn conversations
- Apply constraints to shape response characteristics

## Implementation Notes

The prompts will be implemented in separate files in the `src/workflows/support_desk/prompts/` directory:

1. `clarify_issue_prompt.py`: Contains `ANALYSIS_PROMPT` and `CLARIFICATION_PROMPT`
2. `classify_issue_prompt.py`: Contains `CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT`
3. `triage_issue_prompt.py`: Contains `TRIAGE_PROMPT`
4. `gather_info_prompt.py`: Contains `INFO_GATHERING_PROMPT`
5. `send_to_desk_prompt.py`: Contains `FINAL_RESPONSE_PROMPT`

Each file will define the prompts as string constants that can be imported by the corresponding node implementation.

## Customization Opportunities

These prompts provide a foundation that can be customized for specific educational needs:

1. **Industry-Specific Terminology**: Adapt language for different sectors (healthcare, finance, etc.)
2. **Complexity Levels**: Adjust detail and sophistication for different student levels
3. **Output Formats**: Modify response formats for different parsing approaches
4. **Additional Constraints**: Add more specific guidelines for specialized behaviors
5. **Alternative Roles**: Change roles to demonstrate different perspectives

This flexibility allows the system to be adapted for various educational contexts while maintaining the core learning objectives.
