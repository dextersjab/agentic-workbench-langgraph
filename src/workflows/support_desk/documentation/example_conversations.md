## Educational Value

These example conversations demonstrate several important concepts:

1. **Workflow Paths**: Different paths through the workflow based on issue type and complexity
2. **Clarification Loop**: How the clarification loop works in practice
3. **State Transitions**: How the state changes throughout the conversation
4. **Response Generation**: How responses are generated based on the current state

Students will learn:
- How different issues are handled by the workflow
- How the clarification loop improves issue understanding
- How state transitions drive the conversation flow
- How to design effective responses for different scenarios

## Implementation Notes

These example conversations are implemented in `src/workflows/support_desk/examples/` and include:

1. `simple_hardware_issue.json`: Example of a simple hardware issue
2. `network_issue_with_clarification.json`: Example of a network issue with clarification
3. `complex_software_issue.json`: Example of a complex software issue with multiple clarifications

Each example includes the full conversation history and state transitions, providing a comprehensive view of the workflow in action.
