# Learning Outcomes and Educational Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the learning outcomes and educational approach for the IT Service Desk with Conditional Loop Pedagogy. The system is designed as an educational tool to teach students about prompt engineering and LangGraph conditional logic through practical exercises.

## Learning Progression

The learning progression is structured in two phases:

1. **Phase 1: Linear Workflow (Prompt Engineering Focus)**
2. **Phase 2: Conditional Loop (LangGraph Logic Focus)**

This progressive approach allows students to first master prompt engineering before tackling the more complex concepts of conditional logic in LangGraph.

## Phase 1: Linear Workflow (Prompt Engineering Focus)

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, students should be able to:

1. **Design Effective Prompts**: Create prompts that elicit specific information or generate structured responses
2. **Implement Conversation Management**: Manage multi-turn conversations with context preservation
3. **Apply Role-Based Prompting**: Use role definitions to guide LLM behavior
4. **Create Structured Outputs**: Design prompts that generate consistent, parseable responses
5. **Implement Business Logic**: Translate business requirements into effective prompts

### Node-Specific Learning Outcomes

#### 1. clarify_issue

- Design prompts that assess input clarity
- Create prompts that generate specific, focused questions
- Implement conversation management techniques

#### 2. classify_issue

- Design classification prompts with clear categories
- Implement confidence scoring in prompts
- Create prompts that extract multiple attributes (category and priority)

#### 3. triage_issue

- Design routing logic prompts
- Create prompts that match categories to appropriate teams
- Implement priority-based routing

#### 4. gather_info

- Design information collection prompts
- Create prompts that gather comprehensive details
- Implement context-aware information gathering

#### 5. send_to_desk

- Design response formatting prompts
- Create prompts that generate professional handoff messages
- Implement ticket creation and confirmation

### Teaching Approach

In Phase 1, the teaching approach focuses on prompt engineering:

1. **Guided Prompt Development**: Students are provided with empty prompt templates and guided to fill them in
2. **Incremental Complexity**: Each node introduces new prompt engineering concepts
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Students can test their prompts and see the results immediately
4. **Real-World Context**: All exercises are framed in the context of a realistic IT support scenario
5. **Clear Success Criteria**: Each prompt has specific success criteria for evaluation

## Phase 2: Conditional Loop (LangGraph Logic Focus)

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, students should be able to:

1. **Implement Conditional Edges**: Create conditional branches in LangGraph workflows
2. **Design Predicate Functions**: Write functions that examine state to determine workflow paths
3. **Manage State Across Loops**: Track and update state throughout multi-turn conversations
4. **Prevent Infinite Loops**: Implement mechanisms to prevent infinite loops in conversational workflows
5. **Create Adaptive Workflows**: Design workflows that adapt based on user input quality

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Conditional Edges

- How to add conditional edges to a LangGraph workflow
- When to use conditional edges vs. linear flows
- How to map predicate function returns to destination nodes

#### 2. Predicate Functions

- How to design predicate functions that examine state
- How to return string literals that determine the next node
- How to make decisions based on state variables

#### 3. State Management

- How to track state across multiple turns of conversation
- How to update state based on user input and LLM responses
- How to use state to inform conditional logic

#### 4. Loop Prevention

- How to track loop iterations
- How to implement maximum attempt limits
- How to gracefully exit loops when necessary

### Teaching Approach

In Phase 2, the teaching approach focuses on LangGraph concepts:

1. **Extending Existing Code**: Students extend their Phase 1 implementation with conditional logic
2. **Focused Modifications**: Students focus on specific parts of the code related to conditional logic
3. **Experimentation**: Students are encouraged to experiment with different predicate functions
4. **Debugging Exercises**: Students debug common issues like infinite loops
5. **Advanced Challenges**: Optional challenges for implementing more complex conditional logic

## Pedagogical Techniques

### 1. Scaffolded Learning

The system provides scaffolding that gradually reduces as students progress:

- **Phase 1**: High scaffolding with structured prompt templates
- **Phase 2**: Medium scaffolding with guidance on conditional logic
- **Advanced Challenges**: Low scaffolding with open-ended problems

### 2. Active Learning

Students learn by doing through:

- Implementing prompts for specific business tasks
- Testing their implementations with real inputs
- Debugging issues in their code
- Extending the system with new features

### 3. Contextual Learning

All exercises are framed in the context of a realistic IT support scenario, providing:

- Authentic business context
- Real-world use cases
- Practical applications of concepts
- Professional communication standards

### 4. Feedback Loops

The system provides multiple feedback mechanisms:

- Immediate testing of prompts
- Visualization of workflow execution
- Comparison with example conversations
- Automated evaluation of outputs

### 5. Reflection and Analysis

Students are encouraged to reflect on their implementations through:

- Analyzing conversation logs
- Comparing different prompt approaches
- Evaluating the effectiveness of conditional logic
- Identifying areas for improvement

## Assessment Approach

### 1. Formative Assessment

Throughout the learning process, students receive formative assessment through:

- Testing their prompts with various inputs
- Comparing their outputs with expected results
- Receiving feedback on their implementations
- Identifying and fixing issues in their code

### 2. Summative Assessment

At the end of each phase, students complete summative assessments:

#### Phase 1 Assessment

- Implement all prompts for the linear workflow
- Test with a set of standard inputs
- Evaluate the quality of responses
- Assess the handling of edge cases

#### Phase 2 Assessment

- Implement the conditional loop logic
- Test with inputs of varying clarity
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the loop
- Assess the prevention of infinite loops

### 3. Rubrics

Assessment rubrics focus on:

- **Functionality**: Does the implementation work as expected?
- **Robustness**: Does it handle edge cases and errors?
- **Clarity**: Is the code clear and well-documented?
- **Efficiency**: Is the implementation efficient and performant?
- **Extensibility**: Can the implementation be easily extended?
