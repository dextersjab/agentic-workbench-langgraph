# 📋 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

**HelpHub** is an AI-powered IT support chatbot designed to automatically **categorize**, **prioritize**, and **route** support tickets while providing instant knowledge base assistance. This system serves as a comprehensive case study for building enterprise-grade AI agents using **LangGraph** that handle real-world IT support scenarios through intelligent multi-turn conversations.

### Key Objectives
- **Automate** ticket categorization and routing through conversational AI
- **Reduce** mean time to resolution (MTTR) via intelligent question loops
- **Improve** first-contact resolution rates with dynamic KB search
- **Handle** interruptions, topic changes, and escalation requests seamlessly

## 3. Core Workflows

### 3.1 Multi-Turn Conversation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant H as HelpHub Agent
    participant KB as Knowledge Base
    participant NLP as Categorization Engine
    participant SH as ServiceHub
    
    U->>H: "My computer isn't working"
    H->>KB: Search for similar issues
    KB->>H: No specific match found
    H->>U: "What happens when you try to turn it on?"
    U->>H: "The screen stays black"
    H->>U: "Do you see any lights on the laptop?"
    U->>H: "No lights at all"
    H->>U: "Actually, I need to check email first"
    Note over H: Handle interruption
    H->>U: "I can help with both. Let me create a ticket for the laptop issue first, then help with email"
    H->>NLP: Categorize: "laptop black screen no lights"
    NLP->>H: Category: Hardware, Priority: P1
    H->>SH: Create ticket
    SH->>H: Ticket #12345
    H->>U: "Ticket #12345 created for laptop repair. Now, what's the email issue?"
```

## 4. Realistic Ticket Scenarios

### 4.1 Vague Descriptions
| User Input | Agent Response | Expected Outcome |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| "Everything is broken" | "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what specifically isn't working?" | Question loop to clarify |
| "My computer is slow" | "When did you first notice the slowness? Is it when starting up, opening programs, or browsing?" | Categorize as Performance issue |
| "I can't work" | "What's preventing you from working? Is it a login issue, application problem, or hardware failure?" | Multiple clarifying questions |

### 4.2 Multi-Category Issues
| Scenario | Categorization Challenge | Expected Handling |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| "Can't login to email on new laptop" | Access + Hardware setup | Decompose into two tickets |
| "VPN won't connect and now Teams is down" | Network + Software | Prioritize VPN (likely root cause) |
| "Printer offline and need software installed" | Hardware + Software | Handle separately, software can wait |

### 4.3 Interruption Scenarios
| Original Issue | Interruption | Expected Behavior |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| Password reset request | "Actually, I need to join a meeting first" | Save context, prioritize meeting access |
| Hardware repair | "Wait, is the help desk open now?" | Answer query, return to hardware issue |
| Software installation | "This is urgent, my presentation is in 10 minutes" | Escalate priority, expedite handling |

## 5. Technical Components

### 5.1 Categorization Engine

The system uses a multi-stage NLP pipeline to categorize incoming tickets:

| Category | Common Phrases | Confidence Threshold |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Hardware | "laptop", "battery", "printer", "black screen", "won't turn on" | 0.75 |
| Software | "password", "login", "application", "install", "error message" | 0.80 |
| Network | "wifi", "vpn", "connection", "internet", "can't connect" | 0.70 |
| Access | "permissions", "account", "locked out", "can't access", "reset" | 0.85 |
| Billing | "invoice", "cost", "license", "payment", "subscription" | 0.65 |

## 6. User Journey Examples

### 6.1 Success Journey - Hardware Issue
```
User: "My laptop won't start"
Agent: "I'll help you with that. When you press the power button, what happens?"
User: "Nothing at all, no lights or sounds"
Agent: "Are you using the power adapter or just battery?"
User: "I have it plugged in"
Agent: "I've created ticket #12345 for a hardware repair. This appears to be a power supply issue. A technician will contact you within 2 hours."
```

### 6.2 Complex Journey - Multiple Issues
```
User: "I can't log into my email and my new laptop setup isn't working"
Agent: "I'll help you with both issues. Let's start with your email login - what error do you see?"
User: "It says invalid credentials"
Agent: "I'll create a password reset ticket for you. While that's processing, what's not working with your laptop setup?"
User: "Actually, the email thing is more urgent, I have a client call in 5 minutes"
Agent: "Understood. I'll prioritize the email issue and create an urgent ticket. Try the password reset link I'm sending now."
```

### 6.3 Escalation Journey
```
User: "The server room is flooding!"
Agent: "This is a critical emergency. I'm creating a P1 ticket and immediately notifying the facilities team. Are you in a safe location?"
User: "Yes, I'm out of the room"
Agent: "Ticket #99999 created. Emergency response team has been alerted. Please stay clear of the area."
```

## 7. ServiceHub Integration

### 7.1 Mock Enterprise System

ServiceHub simulates a realistic ITSM platform with:

- **Ticket Management**: Creation, updates, status tracking
- **Assignment Groups**: L1-Hardware, L1-Software, L2-Network, etc.
- **SLA Tracking**: Automatic escalation based on priority
- **Reporting**: Metrics dashboard and KPI tracking

```mermaid
graph LR

    B -->|Webhook| A
    
    A --> C[API Authentication]
    B --> D[Incident Table]
    B --> E[User Table]
    B --> F[Assignment Groups]
    B --> G[SLA Rules]
    
    style B fill:#e3f2fd
    style C fill:#fff3e0
```

### 7.2 API Integration Points

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| `/servicehub/incidents` | POST | Create new ticket | `{"category": "hardware", "priority": "P1"}` |
| `/servicehub/incidents/{id}` | GET | Retrieve ticket status | Returns ticket details |
| `/servicehub/incidents/{id}` | PUT | Update ticket | Add notes, change status |
| `/servicehub/users/{id}` | GET | Get user details | For assignment and notifications |

## 8. Evaluation Criteria
